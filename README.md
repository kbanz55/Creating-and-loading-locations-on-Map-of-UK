This code creates an interactive map of the UK with towns that you can customize in terms of the number of towns 
displayed( limited to a maximum of  500 towns all round UK). 

On hovering over the circle(Location) on the map, details about that location will be displaced.

 The slider is use to increase more circles(Location) on the map, and the load botton 
is use to load and increase the number of circles from the slider. making more circle(location) to be visible on the map.

The Zoom in and Zoom out botton is use to enlarge the and reduce the size of the map to view the map clearer.  The map uses D3.js for map rendering and interaction.
